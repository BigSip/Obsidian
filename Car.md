Submit tow to insurance

My records are merged with Mom's at Lightfoot Hyundai
	They're retarded
	Talk to manager about records
	Confirm they ***chose*** not to service engine despite open recall
		Recall posted to NHTSA September 17, 2021
		Service was in 2022, confirm date with manager

Service claims I may be liable for damage since recall was not done
	But if it's a recall shouldn't it be gratis?
	If my records are merged with mom's, could this work to my advantage?
