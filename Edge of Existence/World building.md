Do you ever just think about the future? Not just 50 or 100 years from now, but 200 or 300. Once mankind has been forced well into the stars. Of course you'll think of the space vessels and laser weapons. But what if something more interesting changed? What if we discovered something that forced us to change our whole view of the universe.

Take, for instance, the total theoretical energy in the universe. What if we discovered the universe was just so much larger than our earthbound sensory equipment could ever fathom?

The universe is expanding. At the speed of light, in every direction. What truly lies at the end? You could never know, you can't travel faster than light. But is the speed of light a conveniently important constant on the cosmic scale? Or is it something more? A universal speed limit? One imposed on our understanding of reality?

What lies at the end? Nothingness? Raw matter that is in a Schr√∂dinger-like superposition between existing and not, what element it could become? Or something more?

What if it's a border? One upon which all universes rest as one giant conglomerate of all that is, was, could be, would be, and even in some senses: isn't.

What if something made this border on purpose? Why? Who? Is it a prison? Or a shield?

What lies beyond the edge of our existence?
