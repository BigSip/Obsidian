Every day I wake up thinking of you
Knowing nothing but that our love is true

And if you don't have much to do
I want to spend my time with you
Baby let me meet you there
And show you how much I care
I'll play with your hair

I know you love me just as I love you
Nothing scares me like hearing we're through
Although for our future, I have faith
I always want to make you feel safe

And if you don't have much to do
I want to spend my time with you
Baby let me meet you there
And show you how much I care
I'll play with your hair
