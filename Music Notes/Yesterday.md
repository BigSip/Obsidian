Yesterday
That's what I say you're Mr. Yesterday
Don't delay, we won't pay
For all the things that you threw away

That's what we say cause Mr. Yesterday
Runs the day, you can't get away
Another motherfuckin Culture Vulture,
covering himself in lei
No one gets a say, all must go his way

Yesterday, Yesterday
Everybody listen up it's Mr. Yesterday

The women, the children, the motherfuckin Earth
Doesn't even matter, you're another fuckin serf
You think you've got a chance, but who owns your home turf?
He owns all from the mountains, down to the surf
